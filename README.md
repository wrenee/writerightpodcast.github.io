# The Write Right Podcast
## A podcast by the Texas A&M University Writing Center.

This site provides the XML generation for the Write Right podcast. It's not really meant to be used on its front end, but I made it look pretty just because. 

Find more about the Texas A&M University Writing Center [on their website](http://writingcenter.tamu.edu).

Currently maintained by [Davis Land](http://davisland.info).

Site originally based on (read: I heavily modified) [Otter Pop](https://github.com/tybenz/otter-pop/) by [Tyler Benziger](http://tybenz.com/).
